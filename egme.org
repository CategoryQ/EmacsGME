#+TITLE: EmacsGME
#+DESCRIPTION: A variety of elisp functions for implementing a solo role-playing games-master emulator, for playing a full game within an org-file
#+PROPERTY: header-args


* Introduction

The basic idea is to define some functions within Emacs lisp, to facilitate solo role-playing. Then you'll be able to M-x or assign key-binds to quickly roll dice, or get Yes/No oracle results from the GM emulator, fed straight into the document where you are logging your game play. A generic dice roller will be needed (to facilitate any RPG system). As for the GM emulator, I'll need to design a basic system (where outcome likelihood can change), along with a subject/meaning look up table, a way of managing lists of threads/NPCs, and random events popping up.


* Variables

This section will be for defining any variables due for user customization

** Variables for Customize

*** Customize group

The below sets up the group for customize

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
(defgroup egme nil
  "Variables for customizing the Emacs Games Master Emulator."
  :group 'games
)
#+END_SRC


*** Print Ouptut

The below variables define the "braces" around any games-master output. These are set using ~defcustom~ so they can be changed by the user via ~Customize~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
(defcustom egme-print-line-start "~~|Games Master|~~~~~~~~~"
  "String printed before games master ouput in non-org buffers."
  :type 'string
  :group 'egme
)

(defcustom egme-print-line-end "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
  "String printed after games master output in non-org buffers."
  :type 'string
  :group 'egme
)
#+END_SRC

** Internal Variables

Variables that are not directly exposed to the user for customization

*** History Lists

The below sets a list to be used for the dice roll function's history.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
(setq egme-dice-history (list))
#+END_SRC


*** Probability List

The below list is used for selecting probabilities when asking yes/no questions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
; Standard probability list for ido-completing-read
(setq egme-probability-list (list
  "0  Even odds"
  "-1  Unlikely"
  "-2  Very Unlikely"
  "-3  Extremely Unlikely"
  "-4  Near Impossible"
  "+4  Near Certain"
  "+3  Extremely Likely"
  "+2  Very Likely"
  "+1  Likely")
)
#+END_SRC


*** Random events

The below intitializes the ~egme-random-counter~ as zero, and set's the possible random events to be generated.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
(setq egme-random-counter 0)

  "NPC positive"
  "NPC negative"
  "Ambiguous event")
)
#+END_SRC


* Functions

Below are the planned functions, along with some scratch code testing ideas.

** Helper functions

These functions are used internally, to break apart code and help with readablility & reuse

*** DONE Random List Item
CLOSED: [2021-06-29 Tue 15:35]

This function takes a list as input, and returns a random element. This is used several times so broken out into it's own function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
(defun egme-random-list-item (list-to-pick-from)
  "This function takes a list as an argument, and returns a random element from within that list.

Will return nil if list is empty."

  (cond
   (list-to-pick-from
    (nth (random (length list-to-pick-from)) list-to-pick-from)
    )
   )
)
#+END_SRC


*** DONE Getting Dice Input
CLOSED: [2021-06-16 Wed 16:02]

For dice rolls, we will get user input from the mini-buffer using ~read-string~... Below will ask for a dice roll and set it to the variable ~egme-current-dice~. This function will be non-interactive, so it is only called by other functions, so it can be paired with calculation/printing/etc.


The below regexp is used to check if the variable contains a valid dice input, but if there is no leading number then one is inserted.
[1-9][0-9]?[dD][1-9][0-9]*\\([+-][0-9]+\\)?

A history of dice rolls requested is stored in the variable ~egme-dice-history~, and if no user input at-all is given then the last input is repeated.

The dice input function egme-get-dice:-
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
  (defun egme-get-dice ()
    "Get the required dice-roll from user input on the mini-buffer. Dice rolls to be expected in the usual [number]D[dice-type][modifier] format used by RPGs, for example '2D6' for 2 six-sided dice, or '3d8+2' for 3 eight-sided dice, with 2 added to the result. If the format is given without number (for example 'd100'), then it is assume to be a single dice being rolled.

If no input is given, then it will return the last dice rolled. A full history of rolls is stored in 'egme-dice-history', accessible via the arrow keys when asked for input.

Returns the dice-type, which is also stored in the variable egme-current-dice - returns nil if input can't be parsed into a dice roll."
    
    ; Get user input
    (setq egme-current-dice (read-string (format "Enter dice roll (default %s): " (car egme-dice-history)) nil 'egme-dice-history (car egme-dice-history)))
  
    ; Add a leading "1" in case user inputs without type (i.e just "D100")
    (if (string-match "^[dD]" egme-current-dice)
        (setq egme-current-dice (concat "1" egme-current-dice))
      )
  
    ; Look for string in dice-roll format
    (if (string-match "[1-9][0-9]?[dD][1-9][0-9]*\\([+-][0-9]+\\)?" egme-current-dice)
        ; ***If*** regex matches, set egme-current-dice to the current roll
        (setq egme-current-dice (match-string 0 egme-current-dice))
      ; ***Else*** set it to nil
      (setq egme-current-dice nil)
      )
  
    egme-current-dice
  )
#+END_SRC

The selected dice can later be returned by evaluating it's name.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(egme-get-dice)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2d6

In the case that a dice-roll cannot be parsed, the output will be ~nil~ so it can be easily read in control functions later.


*** DONE Calculating dice rolls
CLOSED: [2021-06-18 Fri 00:18]

Below is how the dice roll is deconstructed.

First it will get the leading digits to see how many dice are being rolled, then the digits following [dD] for the dice type being used, and lastly the modifier. These numbers are stored in the following variables, in case they are required elsewhere later:-
+ ~egme-current-dice-quantity~
+ ~egme-current-dice-type~
+ ~egme-current-dice-modifier~

Once that info has been extracted, it loops the amount of times in the quantity, generating a random number up to the dice type and summing, then applying the modifier. In the case of a multiple D6 type (ie D66/D666/D6666...) then instead of summing the results it treats each roll as a different digit in the final number.

The final result is stored as ~egme-roll-result~ - this is reset to 0 each time this function is called, in the case of error there will be a zero output rather than the results from a previous roll.

This can be called with a string of the dice roll (or passing the ~egme-get-dice~ function), else it will fallback to the last roll stored in the variable ~egme-current-dice~. User dice roll history will only be affected when using the ~egme-get-dice~ function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
(defun egme-calculate-dice (&optional dice-roll)
  "Calculates the current dice roll. If called alone, it rolls the variable egme-current-dice. If the optional argument of 'dice-roll' is provided, it will roll that - it must be in RPG dice notation ('1d20', '3d10+8', '2d6-4', etc). It returns the result of the dice roll, and saves the result in the variable egme-roll-result for further usage.

This breaks down the current dice into the following variables for calculating:-
 +egme-current-dice-quantity
 +egme-current-dice-type
 +egme-current-dice-modifier

This function loops for the quantity of dice, summing up random numbers for the appropriate type, then applying the modifier. In the case of a multiple D6 type (ie D66/D666/D6666...) then instead of summing the results it treats each roll as a different digit in the final number."

  ; Reset last roll result
  (setq egme-roll-result 0)
  (setq egme-multi-6-temp nil)

  ; Set egme-current-dice if an option was passed with the function call
  (if dice-roll

    (setq egme-current-dice-modifier (string-to-number (match-string 0 egme-current-dice)))
    ; If nil, set modifier to 0
    (setq egme-current-dice-modifier 0)
  )
  
  ; Check if dice type is a D66/D666/D6666 etc
  (if (string-match "^66+$" (number-to-string egme-current-dice-type))
    ; If a multi-6 dice, roll each D6 and combine as string, then repeat for each quantity of rolls
    (dotimes (n egme-current-dice-quantity)
      (dotimes (n (length (number-to-string egme-current-dice-type)))
        (setq egme-multi-6-temp (concat egme-multi-6-temp (number-to-string (+ 1 (random 6)))))
      )
      (setq egme-roll-result (string-to-number egme-multi-6-temp))
    )

    ;Else calculate dice as usual
    ; Loop the amount of dice, generating a random number for each

*** DONE GM Printed Output
CLOSED: [2021-06-19 Sat 00:39]

This is the core function for output to the user.

Jump to the end of the line, add 2 newlines, add the eGME start line, then the function output (a string taken as an argument), then the eGME end lines. Start and end lines are user configurable via ~customize~, so it can be fomratted however they would like. If the current buffer is an org-mode document, it will instead enclose the output in a quote block (which should provide  better output if exporting the org document later).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent

#+END_SRC


*** DONE Random Events
CLOSED: [2021-06-30 Wed 23:11]

The following function will be called from the oracle, and check to see if a random event happened. If so, it will append the details of the random event to ~egme-oracle-output~ to be printed along with the normal outcome of the question.

Every time a random event is checked for, the variable ~egme-random-counter~ is incremented. This is compared to a 1d20 roll - if the roll is lower than the random counter, then a random event has occured. Any text for the random event is added to the ~egme-oracle-output~ string, then the counter is reset. This has the effect that the more questions that are asked, the more likely a random event is to occur.

I may have to change the comparison roll from a D20 - may need some fine tuning to get the frequency right

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
  (defun egme-random-event ()
    "A function for genereating unexpected events.

A focus, action and subject are randomly selected from the lists (egme-random-event-list, egme-action-list, and egme-subject-list respectively). If a random event was generated, the counter is reset to 0.

This function then returns the random event text, for the calling function to pass on to for user output."

** User-facing functions

*** DONE Rolling Dice
CLOSED: [2021-06-19 Sat 00:38]

This function is how the user is expected to interact with the dice roller (typically via a key-bind). It will call the egme-get-dice command, followed by the egme-calculate-dice command, and then output the info in a human-readable format through ~egme-print-output~ - with a smattering of error-checking along the way.

Will also retrun the value of the roll, along with printing the games master output to the current buffer.

*** DONE Yes/No Oracle
CLOSED: [2021-06-30 Wed 23:11]

When first ran, this will ask the usser what question they are asking. This can be ignored by just entering no text

For the oracle, there is a list of different options for the probabilty of a success (likely/even odds/unlikely/etc..) which the user selects interactively. This is seleceted via the function ~ido-completing-read~, using the left & right keys.

For the Oracle, you roll ~1D10~ - on a 6+ the answer is "Yes", on a 5 or less the answer is "No" - this dice roll is modified based on the following probabilities:-
- Near Certain (+4)
- Extremely Likely (+3)
- Very Likely (+2)
- Likely (+1)
- 50/50 (0)
- Unlikely (-1)
- Very Unlikely (-2)
- Extremely Unlikely (-3)
- Near Impossible (-4)

This result can be transformed further. ~1D8~ is rolled alongside this, and on a roll of 1 the result is appened with ", but..", on a roll of 2 it's appended with ", and..." - anything else is ignored. These modifiers are to be interpreted as a partial result ("but" implies some hinderance to the answer) or an extreme result ("and" implies the answer goes beyond what is expected) respectively.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes :results silent
  (defun egme-y-n-oracle ()
    "The basic oracle function. This will provide Yes/No answers to questions posed to the games master, and outputs the results in the current buffer in the standard games master format.

The user will be asked to input a question - if the end of the current line is parsed as a question, then that will be set as the initial user input. If a quesiton is provided, it will be printed along with the results.
Next, the user will be asked for the likelihood of this result. These options are stored in the list egme-probability-list, and selected via ido-completing-read. Each option is a modifier between -4 and +4, along with a basic description of the probability. This basic description will be printed along with the results.
The answer is generated by rolling 1D10 and applying the chosen modifier, any result of a 6+ will be a 'Yes', anything else a 'No'. A D6 is also rolled, to see if it is an extreme answer - on a 1 it is a minor result (', but...'), and on a 2 it is a major result (', and...').
