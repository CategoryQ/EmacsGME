#+TITLE: EmacsGME Readme

* EmacsGME

** Introduction

EmacsGME is a gamesmaster emulator in the style of MythicGME/CRGE/etc, produced in emacs-lisp for playing solo-roleplaying games entirely within org-mode documents.

As this is my first real use of emacs-lisp, a lot of it is just me trying out different things in a literate-programming style, with my exploratory document eventually due to tangle into an emacs-lisp file for easy addition into any emacs-setup.
